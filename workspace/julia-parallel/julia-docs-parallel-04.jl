Concurrency is two lines of customers ordering from a single cashier (lines take turns ordering); 
Parallelism is two lines of customers ordering from two cashiers (each line gets its own cashier).

Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.

Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.

Concurrency refers managing multiple threads of execution, where parallelism is more specifically, multiple threads of execution executing simultaneously. Concurrency is the broader term which can encompass parallelism.

Note: independentability (either one of you can do it) 
and interruptability (you can stop it and resume it later). 

Asynchronous methods aren't directly related to the previous two concepts (concurrent and parallel), asynchrony is used to present the impression of concurrent or parallel tasking but effectively an asynchronous method call is normally used for a process that needs to do work away from the current application and we don't want to wait and block our application awaiting the response. 

It's probably worth adding that in many implementations an asynchronous method call will cause a thread to be spun up but it's not essential, it really depends on the operation being executed and how the response can be notified back to the system.

=====================
Differences between concurrency vs. parallelism

Now letâ€™s list down remarkable differences between concurrency and parallelism.

Concurrency is when two tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time, eg. on a multi-core processor.

Concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

An application can be concurrent  but not parallel, which means that it processes more than one task at the same time, but no two tasks are executing at same time instant.

An application can be parallel but not concurrent, which means that it processes multiple sub-tasks of a task in multi-core CPU at same time.

An application can be neither parallel nor concurrent, which means that it processes all tasks one at a time, sequentially.

An application can be both parallel and concurrent, which means that it processes multiple tasks concurrently in multi-core CPU at same time.

The different levels of parallelism offered by Julia. We can divide them in three main categories :

    (1) Julia Coroutines (Green Threading) = Tasks and Channels
    (2) Multi-Threading
    (3) Multi-Core or Distributed Processing

Tips for parallel programming

When multiple processes or tasks are being used for a computation, the workers should communicate back to a single task for displaying the progress bar. This can be accomplished with a RemoteChannel:
